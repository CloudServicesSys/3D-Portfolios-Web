# 🌐 3D Portfolio Website – AWS-Powered CI/CD Deployment

An interactive, modern 3D portfolio website built using **Vite**, **React**, and **Three.js**, designed to deliver a visually compelling user experience. Deployed using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with **GitHub Actions**, **Amazon S3**, and **CloudFront** for global content delivery.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- FRONTEND: React, Vite, Three.js, JavaScript
- BUILD & TOOLING: npm, vite
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- HOSTING: AWS S3 (static site), AWS CloudFront (CDN)
- SECURITY: OAC (Origin Access Control), HTTPS via CloudFront



## ⚙️ Features

- 🎨 Smooth 3D animations and interactive canvas via `@react-three/fiber`
- 📦 Static hosting with optimized build via Vite
- 🔁 Auto-deploy from GitHub `main` branch using GitHub Actions
- 🌐 Global delivery with CloudFront
- 🔐 Secure bucket access using OAC (no public S3 exposure)
- 🧭 SPA routing support (React Router + `index.html` fallback)

## 📦 Deployment Notes

This project uses GitHub Actions to:

* Run `npm ci` and `npm run build` on push to `main`
* Sync `dist/` to a private S3 bucket
* Invalidate CloudFront cache for instant content refresh

Secrets are configured in GitHub under the `Cloud` environment:

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* `AWS_REGION`
* `AWS_S3_BUCKET`
* `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`


## 📌 Why This Project Stands Out

* ✅ Demonstrates modern web development and performance optimization
* ✅ Covers production-grade CI/CD with GitHub Actions
* ✅ Clean, scalable, and extensible architecture


## 🙌 Credits

This project uses UI/UX inspiration from the [JavaScript Mastery 3D Portfolio Tutorial](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/3d-portfolio) with extended AWS automation and architecture.
